You are given three tables:

create table books(id int, title varchar(250), year int, author varchar(250))
create table reviewers (id int, name varchar(250))
create table ratings (reviewer_id int, book_id int, rating int, rating_date, date)
Problem statement

Find pairs of reviewers such that both gave a rating to the same book.

Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once.

Return reviewer pairs by returning their full names in two columns of the same row. Rviewer from first column should have full name preceding name of second reviewer in alphabetical order.
